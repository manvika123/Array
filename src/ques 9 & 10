Ques9. Can you change size of array once created?
Ans. An array is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single
     type. The length of an array is established when the array is created.
     After creation, its length is fixed. However, one can use ArrayList provided
     by Collections API where size doesn't matter.

Ques10. Can you store String in an array of Integer in Java?
        Compile time error or runtime exception?
Ans. No, we cannot store String in an array of Integer in Java , otherwise, there is
     no point of declaring the data-type of Arrays during its initialization.
     It will show Compile Time error.
     For example: int[] a = new int[10]; clearly specifies that integer has to be
     stored in an array and not any other type.
